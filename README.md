OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
Project: DIGITAL LOCK DESIGN USING VERILOG
Objective:
The objective is to design logic circuits like logic gates, adders and multiolexers using Verilog within the VLSI software and then simulating the Verilog design to ensure correct functionaality.Using the waveform viewer in the VLSI software to analyze the simulation results.
Key Activities:
Wrote the verilog code to describe the digital circuit,This includes defining modules,inputs,outputs and internal signals and describing the behaviour using structural or behavioural modeling.
Created testbenches to simulate the verilog code and verify the correctness of the design against the specifications.Used simulation tools to check for functional and timing correctness.
Performed post synthesis and post implementation simulations tp ensure the design works correctly in the real hardware environment.
